# TODO:
#   Overall:
#       Get admin flag working
#       Edit project form to have repeating
#       Fix closing of all windows to close with master window (important)
#       Make it so that all logging in users have a db user, their user gets built upon login and stored locally
#       Make admin do more stuff, like ability to make new admins etc
#       Implement Error log in some form
#   Things that are broken:
#       Teams are not implemented at all.
#       Clicking a deleted user on another instance crashes the program (unsure on fix)
#       2 instances simultaneously editing one object causes second edit to override changes from first edit.
#           (expected behavior, but not optimal)
#       Cannot update project billing codes (keeps old ones)
